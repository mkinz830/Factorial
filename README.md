## ðŸ“Œ What is a Factorial?

The factorial of a number `n` is written as `n!` and is defined as:

n! = n Ã— (n - 1) Ã— (n - 2) Ã— ... Ã— 1

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. A function `factorial()` is defined to take an integer input.
2. It uses a `for` loop to multiply all integers from 1 up to the input number.
3. The result is returned and printed.

## ðŸ§ª Example

```python
my_test_num = 3
print(factorial(my_test_num))
